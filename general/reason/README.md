# Reason

'Reasons' in unTill Air are brief reports that provide information about 'Voids' and 'Discounts'. POS Users can utilize 'Reasons' to notify the Location Owner about the reasons behind a 'Void' or performed 'Discounts'.&#x20;

The process for using 'Reasons' is straightforward. It allows for either a custom message to be entered directly by the waiter in the POS or the creation of preconfigured reasons that are visible in the POS. These preconfigured 'Reasons' can be selected and applied when recording a 'Discount' or 'Void' transaction in the POS. They become available for use in the POS once the discount or void is acknowledged.
