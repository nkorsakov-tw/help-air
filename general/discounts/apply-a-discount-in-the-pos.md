To **provide your discounts to your customers**, follow these instructions:

1. To access the **'Discounts'** feature, navigate to the **'Discounts'** section on your tablet connected to the Back Office system (instructions on how to connect a tablet can be found [here](../equipment/add-a-device.md)). You can find this option from the order page.
2. Select the discount which is appropriate to your case.

Now that your discounts are ready to be used as part of the restaurant order, you can refer to the manual on [Discounts Reports](../../reports/discounts-reports.md) to enhance your tracking in this area.
