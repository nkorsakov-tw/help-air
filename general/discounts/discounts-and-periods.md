When setting up discounts, you have the opportunity to flexibly adjust the validity period of the discount. You can specify the start date and the end date by specifying the exact period during which the discount will be valid. This will help you create time-limited promotions that meet your needs. As soon as the specified expiration date is reached, the discount will automatically expire.
