# Discounts

You are able to customize your discounts in the Back Office, allowing them to suit your specific business needs. Once configured, these customized discounts will be available in the POS system, integrated into the process of ordering and creating the final bill.&#x20;

The flexibility to customize discounts empowers you to create a diverse range of 'Discount' types based on specific criteria like 'Value type' and 'Discount type.' This level of customization allows you to show appreciation to loyal customers, entice new ones, and strategically optimize your revenue streams. With these configured 'Discounts' in your 'Space', you can effectively implement targeted pricing strategies that align with your business objectives, resulting in a more rewarding and prosperous experience for both you and your customers.
