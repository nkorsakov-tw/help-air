To efficiently manage restaurant orders within the unTill Air system, it is crucial to establish key devices such as printers, terminals, and tablets.

To add a new device, please follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the 'General' > 'Equipment'.
2. Click 'Add new equipment'.
3. Select what kind of devices you want to establish.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: If you have not yet added a printer and terminal to your device list, you will not be able to add a tablet. Therefore, it's necessary to first add a printer and terminal before proceeding to add a tablet.
{% endhint %}

### Add a new printer

1. Provide a name for your new printer.
2. Please select the aim of using it.
3. Provide the technical information about your printer or choose 'Null printer'.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't have a printer yet, select the 'Null printer' feature to simulate the working process without printing actual receipts.
{% endhint %}

4. Click 'Save'.

### Add a new terminal

1. Provide a name for your new terminal.
2. Enter the POIID for your terminal.
3. Click 'Continue'.

### Add a new tablet

{% hint style="info" %}
To add a tablet in the Back Office, you first need to install the 'unTil Air' application on your device.
{% endhint %}

1. Primarily, you have the choice to select the type of tablet functionality that suits your needs. You can opt for either the ['Direct sales'](../../features/sales-modes/direct-sales-mode.md) mode or the ['Table Overview'](../../features/sales-modes/table-plan-mode.md) mode:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Direct sales" %}
This mode is intended for selling items without designated 'Spaces' and its tables. It consists of a POS that directly sells products to customers. In this mode, you won't see spaces where orders are generated; instead, it will display a simple list of products and generate a bill for the client.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Table Plan" %}
This mode is intended for businesses with 'Spaces' where staff members interact with clients. In this mode, you will have a specific 'Space' in the POS, which can be [set up in the Back Office](../../features/spaces/manage-spaces-bo.md). You will have access to lists of orders from different tables, allowing you to efficiently manage them.&#x20;
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### If you have 'Direct sales' mode:

* Specify the number of tables;
* Select the 'Space' which you'll use;
* Select the printer;
* Scan the QR Code using your tablet.

#### If you have 'Table Plan':

* Select the printer;
* Scan the QR Code using your tablet.
