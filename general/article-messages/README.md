# Article messages

In the Back Office 'Article messages' are used to specify customer needs. These messages play an important role when taking an order, as POS Users (waiters) may receive requests from clients regarding the preparation and service of a dish, along with additional clarifications.

These 'Article messages' serve as a means of communication between the POS Users in the 'Space' and the Kitchen, ensuring that the customer's specific requirements are understood. POS Users can transfer detailed instructions or preferences from the client, such as dietary restrictions, cooking preferences, etc. This helps to ensure that the dish is prepared and served exactly as desired, enhancing the overall dining experience for the customer.
