# Categories

Categories within unTill Air serve as a crucial mechanism for orchestrating and structuring the diverse range of products your restaurant offers. Operating within a hierarchical framework, 'Categories' represent the broadest level of this structure, encompassing 'Groups', 'Departments', and 'Articles'.&#x20;

This approach empowers you to manage your inventory, facilitating streamlined organization and administration of your offerings. 'Categories' serve as the foundational framework upon which your 'Groups', 'Departments', and 'Articles' are constructed, ensuring that each product finds its rightful place within the broader context of your restaurant's 'Spaces'.&#x20;
