This payment system ensures that the Location Owner gains a share of the benefit from proceeding with the transactions.

This integration not only simplifies payments but also offers a significant financial advantage to businesses, making it an ideal choice for maximizing profitability and optimizing operations.

## Requirements of working with unTill Payments

For working with unTill Payments, you must accept the system of monetization, which is described below, and agree to use specific Payments Terminals for performing transactions. unTill Payments supports a wide range of different payment methods, including:

* Maestro
* Mastercard
* VPay
* Visa
* Banonact
* Girocard

The split amounts in unTill Payments depend on the specific payment method selected by the customer. Each payment method may have its own unique fee structure and splitting model, determining how the funds are allocated among the involved parties. When a customer chooses a particular payment method to pay the bill, the unTill Payments system automatically calculates the split amounts based on the predefined rules associated with that specific method. These rules take into account factors such as transaction fees, processing costs, and revenue-sharing agreements between the Location Owner, Reseller, and unTill.

So, if the customer opts to pay with Maestro, the system will follow the preconfigured guidelines for Maestro transactions, allocating the appropriate portions of the payment to the respective accounts of the involved parties. Similarly, the split amounts may differ for other supported methods like Mastercard, VPay, Visa, Banonact, and Girocard, based on their individual rules and fee structures.

## Monetization

Monetization in unTill Payments is built on a sophisticated concept of distributing the payment amount among three distinct accounts: the Location Owner's account, the Reseller's account, and the unTill's account. Here's how the process unfolds:

*   When a customer pays the bill using the Payment Terminal, the funds are channeled through the secure Adyen Platform. At this stage, the splitting of the amount occurs. The payment amount is divided into three parts, with each portion being allocated to the respective accounts of the involved parties:

    * The first portion goes directly to the Location Owner's account, rewarding them for their business and services rendered.
    * The second portion is credited to the Reseller's account, acknowledging their role in facilitating the unTill Payments integration.
    * Lastly, unTill receives its share, enabling it to continue providing innovative products.&#x20;



This seamless and efficient process ensures that each party receives its rightful share of the payment, promoting transparency and fairness in the monetization process.

The split amounts are accumulated on the Adyen platform for each involved part until the receiver decides to transfer them into their own account. As the Location Owner, you have the flexibility to customize the transfer dates and amounts through the unTill Payments Portal. This allows you to specify when and how much you would like to receive as a payout.&#x20;

The daily payout increases the total benefits after each business day, ensuring regular Adyen account replenishment that is directly transferred to the relevant accounts. This systematic approach enables all parties involved to receive their funds promptly and benefit from the transactions at the right time.
