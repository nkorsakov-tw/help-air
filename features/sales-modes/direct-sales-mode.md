### What's the Direct Sales mode?

This mode is specifically designed for Point of Sale businesses that do not have dining spaces where staff accommodates clients. In this mode, the POS does not display any tables, which means you won't have a visual representation of spaces. However, this design allows you to take orders and process them with greater speed and efficiency.&#x20;

This advantage becomes particularly clear for direct sales organizations where the focus is on quick operations. Without the need to manage tables, you can concentrate exceptionally on serving customers and processing their orders seamlessly.&#x20;
