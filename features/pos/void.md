Void is one of the most common POS actions because customers often rethink their orders and may request replacements. This manual will help you find the 'Void' feature on the POS display and provide advice on how to perform 'Void' actions quickly. During your work in the POS, there can be two basic scenarios that involve a 'Void':

* 'Void' during order creation;
* 'Void' after order creation.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Void during order creation" %}
Simply make a 'Void' without further obligatory actions.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Void after order creation" %}
Indicate the 'Void Reason' to complete the action.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Tip: Location Owner can customize in the Back Office standard 'Reasons' to simplify the work with 'Voids' to POS Users. To learn more about the 'Reasons' and how to manage and use them, please refer to the designated page.
{% endhint %}

To make a 'Void', please follow these steps:

1. Open the 'unTill Air' app on your tablet.
2. Create any order.
3. Tap first on the item and then tap on the 'Void' button.

Tip: You can make a 'Void' much easier and quicker by simply swiping on the right side.
{% endhint %}

4. If a 'Void' takes place after initially creating an order, the POS User must indicate the 'Void reason' to complete the action.

Tip: Location Owner has the ability to customize the sequence of displaying POS features according to your preferences. For more detailed information on how to do this, please refer to the designated page.
