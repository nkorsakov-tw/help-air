* Each part of the order will be paid using separate bills.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The 'By item' method of splitting offers a convenient solution when one member of the customer's group wants to leave separately. With this option, the POS User can initiate a 'Split' by items, enabling the departing customer to pay for their individual items only. Meanwhile, the other members of the group can continue ordering additional dishes and drinks.
{% endhint %}

In the 'Payment parts' section, you can view the remaining parts to pay during the splitting process.

### Split the order with repeated items

To split the order by item with repeated items you need to perform additional actions:&#x20;

* To split the repeated item and unitize it, tap on the number '1' on the calculation pop-up;
* Then tap on the item which you need to split;
* This will divide the quantity of the item into separate portions;&#x20;
* Now, you can make a payment for each item separately.
