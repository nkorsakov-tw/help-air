Since the launch you already have at least one user (waiter), but let's look at how to add or remove other users.

To add a new POS User follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the 'Users' on the left sidebar.
2. Click 'Add new user'.
3. Provide the information about the user.
4. Pay attention to different options:

* Allow void
* Allow transfer

If you trust your staff and can afford them making voids and transfers, you are able to give access to waiters to these features.

{% hint style="info" %}
If POS Users do not have permission to perform 'Voids' and 'Transfer tables', but encounter a situation that necessitates such actions, they should seek assistance from the Location Owner or other POS Users who have the authority to perform voids and table transfers.
{% endhint %}

5. Click 'Save' button'.

So, you've added a new user to the list. Now this user can handle POS on a tablet.
{% endhint %}
