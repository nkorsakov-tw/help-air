As you proceed with the subscription process, you may have noticed that the plan you selected comes with a limitation on the number of 'Screens' - devices you can connect.&#x20;

This is the reason, why replacing a tablet becomes particularly relevant if you need to connect a new tablet but you have a limitation according to the subscription.

In general, if you wish to add an additional tablet beyond the limit allowed by your current subscription plan, you will need to consider upgrading to a new plan that accommodates your requirements.&#x20;

On the other hand, if you decide to replace one of the tablets from the list of established devices with another tablet, you can conveniently change the active tablet by following a few simple steps.

To delete the active tablet from your list, please follow these instructions:

1. Navigate to the 'Equipment' and switch to the 'Tablets' section.
2. Hover over the line of the tablet you want to remove and click the 'delete' sign.

_Now, you can add a new tablet in place of the previous one._
