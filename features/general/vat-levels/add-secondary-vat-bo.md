Products can be sold in different 'Spaces', which means that the VAT for each 'Space' can vary. For example, a product sold in a restaurant may have a different VAT rate compared to the same product sold directly at a point of sale. To accommodate this, there is a need to add a secondary VAT to individual items when necessary.

This manual will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to add a second VAT to an item. By following these instructions, you will be able to accurately assign the appropriate VAT rate to each product based on its 'Space'.

To add a secondary VAT, please follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **'Products' > 'Groups'.**
2. Add a new group or edit an existing one.
3. Add a secondary VAT below the first VAT field.
