After assigning a VAT level to a group that includes articles, you will be able to fully utilize it in the POS. This group of articles will be sold with the VAT level that you previously set up. For detailed instructions on setting up VAT levels, please [refer to the provided manual](manage-vat-levels-bo.md).

To assign a VAT level to a group, please follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **'Products' > 'Groups'**.
2. Click on the 'Add new group' button or click on the 'Edit' icon next to an already existing group.
3. Select the needed VAT level for this group.

4. Click **'Continue'.**

Additionally, you have the option to add a secondary VAT to your group. This allows you to assign the group of articles to a new space where a different VAT level may be applicable. For detailed instructions on adding a secondary VAT to your group, please [refer to the provided manual](add-secondary-vat-bo.md).

Now that the group has the new VAT level assigned, you can use it in the 'Spaces' associated with each group.
