# Courses

In the restaurant, the order in which dishes are served to customers follows a certain sequence. To facilitate this, the 'Courses' feature in unTill Air allows Location Owners to categorize 'Articles' into different parts or 'Courses'. These 'Courses' typically include starters, main dishes, and desserts.

By dividing the menu into 'Courses', Location Owners can effectively organize the serving process and ensure that dishes are served in the appropriate order.

The POS User, such as a waiter, can fit the 'Course' sequence based on the customer's preferences. In cases where a customer wishes to skip a particular 'Course' and proceed directly to the next one, the waiter can utilize the 'Fire next course' button in the POS. This functionality allows the POS User to seamlessly move to the next 'Course', accommodating the customer's request and ensuring a personalized dining experience.&#x20;

'Courses' in unTill Air assume visual clarity and guidance for POS Users. Each 'Course' is assigned a distinct colour, allowing for quick and intuitive identification during the order-taking and serving process.&#x20;
