In unTill Air, there are two types of articles: 'Articles' and 'Special Articles':

| Articles                                                                                                                                   | Special Articles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| These are the usual articles that are assigned to specific departments. They are only visible in the POS within their assigned department. | These articles have distinct characteristics. Unlike regular articles, they can be made visible in multiple departments. This means that 'Special Articles' can appear in both the initial department they were assigned to and any additional departments you specify. |

To create a 'Special Article', please follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the 'Products' > 'Departments'.
2. Click 'Add new department' or click on the 'edit' icon next to an already existing department.
3. Provide a name for your new department.
4. Select the group and spaces.
5. In the section 'Special Articles' click on the 'Assign articles' button.

6. Assign desired articles to another department.

After assigning articles to two different departments, they will be visible in both departments in the POS.&#x20;

In this case, the article 'Orange juice fresh' is available in two departments: 'Lemonades' and 'Juices'. It was initially assigned to the 'Lemonades' department, but later it was also assigned to the 'Juices' department. As a result, in the POS, this article can be accessed and interacted with in both departments.
