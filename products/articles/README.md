# Articles

'Articles' are the fundamental hierarchy level when setting up your products. They represent the names of dishes and beverages listed in the products section. These 'Articles' are assigned to different 'Departments' and 'Groups', forming the foundation for completing orders.&#x20;

When a customer places an order, the POS User can easily access the list of 'Articles' and efficiently manage the order process using this list.&#x20;

'Articles' can be enriched with optional additional elements that you are free to set up in the Back Office, such as 'Modifiers' (detailed instructions [can be found on the designated page](../modifiers/)). Moreover, you have the flexibility to create 'Combi deals' for specific 'Articles', providing your customers with enticing offers and promotions (more information [can be found here](../combi-deal/)). With this variety of options, you can manage your product list to suit your restaurant's needs and enhance the ordering process in your 'Space'.
